            With our time on Earth coming to an end, a team of explorers

            beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among
            the stars. From acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan (“The Dark
            Knight” films, “Inception”), “Interstellar” stars Oscar winner

            Ellen Burstyn (“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore”), and Oscar winner
            Michael Caine (“The Cider House Rules”). The main cast also includes
            Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, David Gyasi, Mackenzie Foy and Topher
            Grace. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is written by

          <h3>Joseph Cooper</h3>
          <p>
            Joseph A. Cooper is a trained NASA pilot with an engineering
            background, and the pilot of the interstellar expedition. Cooper has
            two children, Tom Cooper and Murphy Cooper. He is portrayed by actor
            Matthew McConaughey.

          <h3>Murphy Cooper</h3>
          <p>
            Murphy Cooper was the closest of Cooper's children. She had a drive
            to explore and discover the unknown, very much like her mother.
            Suffice it to say she did not like her name, as it had the
            connotation that she was the harbinger of bad luck. However Cooper
            reinforced the idea that her name is in reality a call to hope. One
            morning, she claimed that her room was haunted by a "ghost".

          <h3>TARS</h3>
          <p>
            TARS is one of four former U.S. Marine Corps tactical robots along
            with PLEX, CASE and KIPP featured in the Interstellar universe. He
            is one of the crew members of Endurance along with Cooper, Brand,
            Doyle, Romilly, and CASE. TARS' personality can be characterized as
            witty, sarcastic, and humorous, traits programmed into him to make
            him a better suited companion. TARS also appears to be somewhat more
            versatile than CASE, being suited for tasks ranging from piloting to
            data collection.

            being sent through the wormhole attempting to relocate the human
