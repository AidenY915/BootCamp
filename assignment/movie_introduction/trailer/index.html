      Earth is a rocky planet orbiting a G-type main sequence star known as the
      Sun. The planet is the third in order from its star, home to the human
      species and assorted varieties of flora and fauna. In the middle of the
      21st century, the planet suffered the Blight which threatened to destroy
      all lifeforms on the planet.

      Gargantua is a very massive, rapidly spinning black hole. It is orbited by
      the planets Miller and Mann, as well as an unnamed neutron star. A main
      sequence star Pantagruel was located within a year's flight of Gargantua
      along with the habitable planet Edmunds. Gargantua is within a several
      week spaceflight of the Wormhole.

      Miller's Planet is a planet and the first planet in the system orbiting
      Gargantua. Miller's Planet takes its name from Dr. Laura Miller, who
      landed on the planet with her lazarus pod and activated the "thumbs up"
      beacon. It is also the first location for the crew of the Endurance visit.
