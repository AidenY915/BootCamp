            With our time on Earth coming to an end, a team of explorers
            undertakes the most important mission in human history: traveling
            beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among
            the stars. From acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan (“The Dark
            Knight” films, “Inception”), “Interstellar” stars Oscar winner
            Matthew McConaughey (“Dallas Buyers Club”), Oscar winner Anne
            Hathaway (“Les Miserables”), Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (“Zero
            Dark Thirty”), Bill Irwin (“Rachel Getting Married”), Oscar winner
            Ellen Burstyn (“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore”), and Oscar winner
            Michael Caine (“The Cider House Rules”). The main cast also includes
            Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, David Gyasi, Mackenzie Foy and Topher
            Grace. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is written by
            Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan. Emma Thomas, Christopher Nolan
            and Lynda Obst produced “Interstellar,” with Jordan Goldberg, Jake
            Myers, Kip Thorne and Thomas Tull serving as executive producers.
            Nolan’s behind-the-scenes creative team was led by director of
            photography Hoyte Van Hoytema (“Her”), Oscar-nominated production
            designer Nathan Crowley (“The Dark Knight”), Oscar-nominated editor
            Lee Smith (“The Dark Knight”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer
            Mary Zophres (“True Grit”). The score was composed by Oscar winner
            Hans Zimmer (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “The Lion King”).
            Interstellar is nominated for 4 BAFTA 2015 Film Awards including:
            Best Original Music, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and
            Best Special Visual Effects. Interstellar received 5 nominations at
